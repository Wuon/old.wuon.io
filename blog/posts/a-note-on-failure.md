Failure hurts. This fall, I had an amazing opportunity to fly out and interview for Microsoft Vancouver, but unfortunately fell short. After coming back empty-handed, I was welcomed with words of encouragement from my friends and family. I am incredibly thankful, but there is one phrase that sticks out the most.

> "Don't worry you'll get it next time!"

I find myself in pain when I hear these words, not because I don't want to hear them (I am still thankful for the support), but rather because that "next" time is eight months away. However, I don't necessarily believe this to be a bad thing. If anything, I believe this suffering demonstrates exactly how much I wanted the opportunity. It definitely doesn't mean I'm going to give up either.

Relatively speaking, eight months is a short time to wait when compared to an Olympic athlete. The amount of patience and dedication required to endure four whole years for another attempt is incredibly inspiring. I can't give up. Yes, eight months is still far from now, but I can only move forward.

I always come back to this quote when I think about giving up. I thank a good friend for sharing this with me.

> "It is not if you get in, but when."

With this mentality, I am determined to try again for Microsoft, and my relentless pursuit for success will be the catalyst that pushes me further and further.

Also, as ironic as it may be, I tell myself that too, that I'll get it next time.
