Half way through 2020, I started thinking about what I really wanted to do in life. My midlife crisis was triggered by reading this one quote.

> “The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The work of life is to develop it. The meaning of life is to give your gift away.” - David Viscott

I thought it was absolutely beautiful. I found so many ways how this could relate back to me and I remember thinking at that exact moment that I would dedicate my life to giving my gift away. I’m extremely fortunate to have already discovered my gift and passion, coding. I have been blessed to work at some amazing companies like Google and Shopify and consider these opportunities a great way to develop my gift. 

The hardest part is figuring out how to give my gift away. For every individual, giving your gift can represent a multitude of things. For me however, I think what speaks to me the most is open-source development.

Now, things could definitely change as I get older. Goals might shift, passions might change. What I can say for now however, is that when I do retire, I’d like to contribute to the open-source community full-time.
